// This is a patch file to fix the MortgageCalculator type issue
// The MortgageCalculator component is in a read-only file, so we can't directly modify it.
// This file documents the required changes needed.

/*
The issue in MortgageCalculator.tsx is that the 'CalcType' type 
doesn't include "findTerm" which is being compared in the component.

The fix would be to update the CalcType type definition:

type CalcType = "standard" | "findLoanAmount" | "findPayment" | "findTerm";

This would resolve the comparison errors at lines 399, 403, and 418.
