          </p>
          <pre className="my-4 dark:text-black">
            θ = sin⁻¹(x)
          </pre>
          <p>
            Where:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>θ</strong>: The angle (in radians or degrees).</li>
              <li><strong>x</strong>: The sine value (must be between -1 and 1).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Domain and Range of Arcsin</h3>

  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Derivatives and Integrals Involving Arcsin</h3>
  <p>
    In calculus, the Arcsin function plays a significant role in differentiation and integration. Understanding how to differentiate and integrate functions involving Arcsin is essential for solving many problems in calculus. Below are the formulas for the derivative and integral of the Arcsin function.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Derivative of Arcsin</h4>
  <p>
    The derivative of the Arcsin function with respect to \( x \) is given by the following formula:
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4 dark:text-black">d/dx [sin⁻¹(x)] = 1 / √(1 - x²)</pre>
  <p>
    This formula is useful when working with functions that involve inverse sine, as it allows us to differentiate such functions efficiently. It is also used in solving problems in physics and engineering, where the rate of change of an angle is needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    This result is important when solving integrals that involve inverse sine, which frequently appear in physics problems dealing with angles, rotations, or projections.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Applications in Geometry</h3>
  <p>
    In geometry, Arcsin is used to calculate angles in right triangles when given a specific ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For example, if you know the sine of an angle, you can use Arcsin to determine the angle itself. This is especially useful in solving trigonometric problems involving triangles and circles.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Example: Right Triangle</h4>
  <p>
    Suppose in a right triangle, the length of the opposite side is 3 units, and the hypotenuse is 5 units. To find the angle \( θ \) using the sine function, you can use the formula:
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4 dark:text-black">sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse = 3 / 5 = 0.6</pre>
  <p>
    Now, to find the angle \( θ \), you apply the Arcsin function:
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4 dark:text-black">θ = sin⁻¹(0.6) ≈ 36.87°</pre>
  <p>
    This is the angle corresponding to the sine value of 0.6, and you can use this method to solve similar problems in geometry.
  </p>

      <li><strong>Δδ</strong>: The difference in declination.</li>
      <li><strong>α₁, α₂</strong>: The right ascension of the two stars.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    By using this formula, astronomers can calculate the exact separation between celestial objects, which helps in mapping the sky and tracking objects like satellites and asteroids.
  </p>
