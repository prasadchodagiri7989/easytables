          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">What is Arctan?</h3>
          <p>
            Arctan (also called the inverse tangent function) is used to determine the angle whose tangent value is a given number.
            The formula for Arctan is:
          </p>
          <pre className="my-4">
            θ = tan⁻¹(x)
          </pre>
          <p>
            Where:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>θ</strong>: The angle (in radians or degrees).</li>
              <li><strong>x</strong>: The tangent value (can be any real number).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Domain and Range of Arctan</h3>
          <p>
            - *Domain*: The tangent value can be any real number, i.e., x ∈ ℝ.<br />
            - *Range*: The result of the Arctan function is an angle between -π/2 and π/2 radians (-90° to 90°), i.e., θ ∈ [-π/2, π/2].
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Example</h3>
          <p>
            If tan(θ) = 1, then θ = tan⁻¹(1) = 45° or π/4 radians.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Applications of Arctan</h3>
  <p>
    The Arctan function is widely used in various fields including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Some of the notable applications are in navigation, control systems, signal processing, and robotics. Arctan helps in determining angles when the ratio of two sides of a right triangle is known. It also finds use in representing complex numbers and polar coordinates.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Arctan in Navigation</h4>
  <p>
    In navigation, Arctan is used to calculate the bearing angle between two points on the Earth’s surface, especially when working with latitude and longitude coordinates. If you have the difference in the coordinates (Δx, Δy), Arctan can be used to calculate the angle between the two points. This is important for determining direction and plotting courses for ships or aircraft.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">θ = tan⁻¹(Δy / Δx)</pre>
  <p>
    Where:
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>θ</strong>: The bearing angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Δy</strong>: The difference in the latitude (or y-coordinate) between two points.</li>
      <li><strong>Δx</strong>: The difference in the longitude (or x-coordinate) between two points.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Arctan in Robotics</h4>
  <p>
    In robotics, Arctan is used for calculating angles of rotation and orientations of robotic arms or mobile robots. The inverse tangent function comes in handy when a robot is navigating through a 2D plane, helping to determine the required angle based on the position of the robot or the obstacles around it.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">θ = tan⁻¹(y / x)</pre>
  <p>
    Where:
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>θ</strong>: The angle of rotation or orientation.</li>
      <li><strong>y</strong>: The position in the y-axis (vertical movement).</li>
      <li><strong>x</strong>: The position in the x-axis (horizontal movement).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Arctan in Signal Processing</h4>
  <p>
    In signal processing, Arctan is used in phase angle calculations. In many systems, the phase of a signal is important for understanding its behavior in relation to other signals. The inverse tangent function helps in determining the phase angle when the ratio of signal components is known. This is particularly important in modulated signals, Fourier transforms, and frequency analysis.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">θ = tan⁻¹(Im / Re)</pre>
  <p>
    Where:
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>θ</strong>: The phase angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Im</strong>: The imaginary component of the signal.</li>
      <li><strong>Re</strong>: The real component of the signal.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Example: Phase Shift in Signal Processing</h3>
  <p>
    In signal processing, two signals with different frequencies and phases may be combined. The Arctan function can be used to determine the phase difference between the two signals. This is done by calculating the inverse tangent of the ratio of their imaginary and real components.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">Phase Difference = tan⁻¹(Imaginary Component / Real Component)</pre>
  <p>
    For example, if one signal has an imaginary component of 5 and a real component of 12, the phase difference is:
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">Phase Difference = tan⁻¹(5 / 12) ≈ 22.6°</pre>
  
  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Arctan in Control Systems</h3>
  <p>
    Arctan plays a crucial role in control systems, especially in designing systems where precise angle control is necessary. The function helps in determining the angle of rotation for motors, actuators, and other systems that need accurate positioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, in a servo system, the angle of the motor can be determined by the ratio of the input signal to the output signal, with Arctan providing the necessary transformation from the ratio to an angular displacement.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Arctan in Geometry and Trigonometry</h4>
  <p>
    In geometry, Arctan is often used to solve for unknown angles in right-angled triangles. If the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides are known, the angle can be calculated using Arctan. This is commonly applied in trigonometry to find the angle between two vectors, lines, or planes.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">θ = tan⁻¹(opposite / adjacent)</pre>
  <p>
    Where:
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>θ</strong>: The angle between the two sides.</li>
      <li><strong>opposite</strong>: The length of the side opposite to the angle.</li>
      <li><strong>adjacent</strong>: The length of the side adjacent to the angle.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Inverse Tangent in Polar Coordinates</h3>
  <p>
    Polar coordinates are another area where Arctan is often used. In polar coordinate systems, a point is described by its radial distance from the origin and the angle from a reference axis (typically the positive x-axis). When the coordinates of a point in the Cartesian plane are known, Arctan can be used to calculate the angle in polar coordinates.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">θ = tan⁻¹(y / x)</pre>
  <p>
    This is particularly useful in fields such as computer graphics, where objects are often manipulated using polar coordinates.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Arctan in Machine Learning</h3>
  <p>
    In machine learning, Arctan can be applied in various ways, particularly in loss functions and optimization algorithms. One common use of the inverse tangent function in machine learning is in transformations that help normalize data for algorithms, especially those dealing with trigonometric features, rotation invariance, or angular data.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Feature Transformation</h4>
  <p>
    When working with angular data or cyclical features (such as time of day, season, or geographical direction), Arctan can be used to map these features into a more useful range. For instance, if the data is represented as a ratio, applying the Arctan function can make the data easier to process for algorithms that require a bounded range.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">normalized_feature = tan⁻¹(original_feature)</pre>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Arctan in Computer Graphics and Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    Arctan is used in computer graphics for various tasks like camera orientation, object rotation, and texture mapping. In 3D graphics, calculating the angle between vectors often involves the Arctan function. When rendering 3D scenes or objects, Arctan can be used to determine the angle of the camera relative to the object or the direction of light.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Object Rotation in 3D Space</h4>
  <p>
    In 3D graphics, Arctan is used for rotating objects based on the mouse movement or keyboard input. By calculating the angle of rotation, Arctan helps determine how much to rotate an object around the x, y, or z-axis to achieve the desired orientation.
  </p>
  <pre className="my-4">θ = tan⁻¹(dy / dx)</pre>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The Arctan function is incredibly versatile and useful in both theoretical and applied contexts.
