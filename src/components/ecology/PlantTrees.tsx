  {/* Trees and Climate Change Mitigation */}
  <div>
    <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Trees and Climate Change Mitigation</h2>
    <p>
      Trees play a vital role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. By absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the leading greenhouse gases contributing to global warming, trees help to balance the Earth's carbon cycle.
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm">
      <li>
        <strong>Carbon Sequestration:</strong> Trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store it as carbon in their biomass and soil. This process, known as carbon sequestration, is essential in the fight against climate change. A single mature tree can absorb about 48 pounds (22 kg) of CO₂ annually.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Carbon Storage:</strong> Forests, especially tropical forests, store billions of tons of carbon. Deforestation and forest degradation release this stored carbon into the atmosphere, accelerating global warming. Planting trees and conserving existing forests is crucial to maintaining this carbon storage capacity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reducing the Urban Heat Island Effect:</strong> Urban areas tend to be hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the concentration of buildings, concrete, and asphalt. Tree planting in cities helps mitigate this effect by providing shade and releasing moisture through transpiration, cooling the surrounding air.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Climate change presents an urgent threat to global ecosystems, and tree planting is one of the most effective and natural solutions for mitigating its effects. By planting and protecting trees, we can work toward a healthier and more stable climate.
