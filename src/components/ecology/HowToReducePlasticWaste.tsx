  <div>
    <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">The Impact of Plastic Waste on the Environment</h2>
    <p>
      Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. It is estimated that over 8 million tons of plastic waste enter the oceans each year. This pollution affects marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Here are some of the key impacts of plastic waste on the environment:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm">
      <li>
        <strong>Harm to Wildlife:</strong> Marine animals often mistake plastic items for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement. This can cause injuries, malnutrition, and death. It is estimated that more than 100,000 marine creatures, including fish, seabirds, and turtles, die each year due to plastic waste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ocean Pollution:</strong> Plastics degrade into smaller particles known as microplastics. These microplastics are not only harmful to marine organisms but also make their way up the food chain, eventually reaching humans through seafood consumption.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Soil and Water Contamination:</strong> When plastic waste is improperly disposed of, it can leach toxic chemicals into the soil and water. These chemicals can contaminate ecosystems and harm both plant and animal life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-Biodegradability:</strong> Plastics can take hundreds of years to break down, leading to long-term environmental damage. While plastics decompose into microplastics, they do not fully degrade, meaning that they persist in the environment indefinitely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resource Waste:</strong> Producing plastic requires fossil fuels, contributing to carbon emissions and resource depletion. The energy and raw materials used in manufacturing plastic products are significant, yet much of this material ends up as waste.
      </li>
