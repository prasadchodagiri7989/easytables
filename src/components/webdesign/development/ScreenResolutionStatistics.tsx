      <h2>Screen Resolution Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Screen resolution</strong> refers to the number of pixels displayed on a screen. It is often represented as width Ã— height, such as 1920x1080 pixels. The resolution of a screen directly affects the clarity and amount of content visible on the screen.

      <h3>Why Screen Resolution Matters in Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        Knowing the common screen resolutions is important for web developers to ensure that websites are optimized for different screen sizes. Responsive web design aims to create layouts that look great across a variety of devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. Below are some reasons why screen resolution matters:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> If a website is not optimized for a particular screen resolution, elements may be cut off, or the website may appear distorted.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile-first Design:</strong> More users access the internet on mobile devices than desktops, so websites must be optimized for smaller screen resolutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Larger screen resolutions often require higher-quality images and assets. Optimizing these assets can reduce load times and improve performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Layout:</strong> A website should adapt its content layout depending on the screen resolution to ensure that text, images, and buttons are properly displayed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Detecting Screen Resolution in JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        You can detect the screen resolution using JavaScript. The <code>window.screen</code> object provides information about the screen's width and height. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`
console.log("Screen width: " + window.screen.width);
console.log("Screen height: " + window.screen.height);
        `}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        This will output the screen's width and height in pixels. You can also detect the resolution available for the browser window, including the height of the taskbar and browser UI, using the <code>window.innerWidth</code> and <code>window.innerHeight</code> properties.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsive Design Tips</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some tips for ensuring your website looks great on all screen resolutions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Media Queries:</strong> CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the screen width. This helps create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Layouts:</strong> Use flexible units like percentages or viewport widths (vw) and heights (vh) instead of fixed pixel values to create fluid layouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Use responsive images that adjust based on the user's screen size to improve performance. You can use the <code>srcset</code> attribute in the <code>img</code> tag.</li>
        <li><strong>Test on Multiple Devices:</strong> Regularly test your website on multiple devices with different screen resolutions to ensure your layout works well on all devices.</li>
      </ul>
