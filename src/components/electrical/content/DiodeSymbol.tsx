<section>
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Diode Behavior and Properties</h2>
  <p>
    Diodes have specific electrical properties that define their behavior in circuits. Key properties include forward voltage, reverse current, and breakdown voltage.
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
    <li><strong>Forward Voltage:</strong> The voltage drop across a diode when it is forward-biased, typically between 0.3V to 0.7V for most diodes.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Current:</strong> The small current that leaks through a diode when it is reverse-biased, often negligible for ideal diodes.</li>
    <li><strong>Breakdown Voltage:</strong> The voltage at which a diode starts to conduct in reverse, particularly relevant for Zener diodes.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Diodes Are Tested</h2>
  <p>
    Testing diodes is an essential skill for understanding their functionality. A multimeter is commonly used to test diodes in circuit boards or individually.
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
    <li><strong>Forward Test:</strong> Set the multimeter to the diode testing mode. The multimeter should show a voltage drop (typically around 0.7V for silicon diodes) when the red probe is connected to the anode and the black probe to the cathode.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Test:</strong> When the multimeter probes are swapped, the reading should show no conduction (open circuit) for a good diode.</li>
    <li><strong>Short Circuit:</strong> If the diode shows no resistance or a voltage drop in both directions, it is likely shorted and needs to be replaced.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Impact of Temperature on Diode Behavior</h2>
  <p>
    Temperature plays a significant role in the performance of diodes. As temperature increases, the reverse leakage current tends to increase, and the forward voltage drop decreases slightly.
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
    <li><strong>Forward Voltage Drop:</strong> For every 10°C increase in temperature, the forward voltage drop for a typical silicon diode decreases by about 2 mV.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Leakage Current:</strong> Reverse leakage current increases exponentially with temperature, which can lead to the diode’s failure if excessive current flows in reverse.</li>
    <li><strong>Thermal Runaway:</strong> In high-power applications, improper cooling of diodes can lead to thermal runaway, where increased temperature leads to more current, further increasing the temperature.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Special Types of Diodes</h2>
