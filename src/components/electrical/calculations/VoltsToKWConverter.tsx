          {/* Advanced Topics Section */}
<div>
  <h2 className="font-semibold text-base mt-6 mb-2">Advanced Topics:</h2>
  <p>While the basic calculation for converting voltage and current to power in kilowatts is relatively straightforward, there are some advanced topics worth understanding in the context of electrical energy:</p>
  <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>
      <strong>Power Factor:</strong> In real-world AC circuits, the power factor (PF) comes into play. The power factor accounts for the phase difference between voltage and current, affecting the actual power being delivered to the load. If the power factor is not 1 (which means the voltage and current are not perfectly in phase), the formula becomes:
      <br />
      <strong>P(kW) = (V × I × PF) / 1000</strong>
      <br />
      Where:
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li><strong>PF</strong>: Power factor (a value between 0 and 1)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AC vs DC Power:</strong> This formula applies to both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC), but power factor adjustments are only necessary in AC circuits. For DC circuits, the voltage and current values are constant, and the conversion is straightforward with the basic formula.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Electrical Efficiency:</strong> It's also important to consider the efficiency of the system when calculating how much usable power is actually being delivered. Electrical systems often have efficiency losses (e.g., heat dissipation, resistance), and these losses need to be accounted for in power calculations for more accurate real-world assessments.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

{/* Historical Context */}
<div>
  <h2 className="font-semibold text-base mt-6 mb-2">Historical Context:</h2>
  <p>Understanding power and its conversion between units has been crucial to the development of electrical engineering:</p>
  <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>
      <strong>The Watt:</strong> The unit of power, the watt (W), is named after James Watt, a Scottish engineer who improved the steam engine in the 18th century. The watt is defined as the rate at which energy is transferred or converted, and it is used to quantify the rate of energy consumption or production.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Kilowatt:</strong> The kilowatt (kW) is a more practical unit for large-scale energy systems. It is widely used in electricity generation, electrical motors, and appliances. For example, power stations and large appliances are often rated in kilowatts to indicate their energy output or consumption.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Energy Storage Systems:</strong> With the rise of renewable energy and battery storage, understanding the relationship between volts, amperes, and kilowatts is even more important. Energy storage systems like batteries often measure energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh), which combines power (in kW) and time.
    </li>
  </ul>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
{/* Advanced Calculations Section */}
<div>
  <h2 className="font-semibold text-base mt-6 mb-2">Advanced Calculations:</h2>
  <p>If you’re working with more complex electrical systems, you may need to apply additional factors to the power calculation. Here are some advanced considerations:</p>
  
  <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>
      <strong>Three-Phase Power Calculations:</strong> In three-phase systems, the formula to calculate power changes. The formula is:
      <br />
      <strong>P(kW) = √3 × V × I × PF / 1000</strong>
      <br />
      Where:
      <ul className="ml-4 list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>√3:</strong> A constant value (approximately 1.732), specific to three-phase systems.</li>
        <li><strong>PF:</strong> Power Factor, used to account for inefficiencies in the system.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      This formula is used in industrial and commercial applications, where power systems often operate in three-phase mode.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>AC Power Factor Consideration:</strong> In alternating current (AC) systems, the power factor (PF) plays a crucial role in determining the actual usable power. For resistive loads (like heaters), the power factor is 1. For inductive or capacitive loads (like motors), the power factor may be lower. To factor this in:
      <br />
      <strong>P(kW) = (V × I × PF) / 1000</strong>
      <br />
      A power factor of less than 1 will reduce the actual power available for useful work, and it’s essential to consider this when designing systems that use AC power.

      <strong>System Efficiency:</strong> Ensure that your system’s efficiency is factored into your calculations. Energy losses through resistive heating, friction, and other inefficiencies can impact the amount of usable power available in your system. This is particularly important in power generation and industrial applications.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Voltage Drop:</strong> Over long distances, electrical systems experience voltage drop due to resistance in the wiring. Ensure that this is accounted for, especially for high-power applications like industrial machinery or long-distance transmission systems.
