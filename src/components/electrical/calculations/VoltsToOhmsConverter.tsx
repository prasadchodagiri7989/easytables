{/* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) */}
<div>
  <h2 className="font-semibold text-base mt-6 mb-2">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):</h2>
  <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>
      <strong>Q: What is Ohm's Law?</strong>
      <p>A: Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. It is expressed as: <strong>I = V / R</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q: What happens if the current is 0?</strong>
      <p>A: If the current is 0A, the resistance is considered infinite. No current flows through the circuit, meaning the circuit is effectively open or broken.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q: Can Ohm’s law be used in AC circuits?</strong>
      <p>A: Yes, but in alternating current (AC) circuits, Ohm’s law is extended to impedance. Impedance accounts for both resistance and reactance in the circuit, which changes with frequency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q: How can I calculate the resistance of components in a parallel circuit?</strong>
      <p>A: For resistors in parallel, use the formula: <strong>1 / R_total = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3 + ...</strong>. The total resistance will be less than the smallest resistor in the parallel network.</p>
